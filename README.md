# Emojinator

The Emojinator is a tool that converts hand-gestures to emojis using a convolutional neural network. 

Two datasets are used for training:
1. Hand gesture [database](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) aquired by Leap Motion. 10 subjects, 10 emojis, ~50,000 images.
2. Emoji recognition [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gsnikkitha/real-time-hand-gesture-recognition). 10 emojis, ~5,000 images.

Real-time emoji classification can also be performed using OpenCV in [Predict.ipynb](Predict.ipynb).
